When I wrote the color scheme I didn't realized it lasts so long and so many people likes it, so I'd like to expand it further to let more applications use the scheme. Vim is the only supported application now, but this is just a start...

Currently, I added configuration files for konsole and xfce4-terminal.

The main source are always in trunk, some unrelated stuffs are in tags, just ignore them.
